# Install Steps

1. download steamlinker

2. In teamspeak 3 go to Tools --> Options (Alt+p) --> Addons --> Browse online --> Search for "python" ---> pyTSon Plugin --> install 

3. drag steamlinker in to your AppData\Roaming\TS3Client\plugins\pyTSon\scripts folder.

4. In teamspeak 3 go to Plugins(should be at the top of the teamspeak 3 client) --> pyTSon --> Settings --> Press "Reload all" --> Tick Steamlinker if it's not ticked --> your done :D

#Note:
When it first installs a cmd will popup, dont worry it's nothing doggy. It's installing the opensource python pips to allow the update notification system to work(version.json), if you want to see yourself go to line 32 in __init__.py :)
