# Steamlinker
Steamlinker, adds a feature in to teamspeak 3 where you can click a steam link and it would open in your steam client instead of your default browser.

Note: Atm it only works for the store, there would be some bugs for now.

More feature will be coming to allow you to have a smoother experience with steam and teamspeak 3 combined.

# Install Steps

1. download steamlinker

2. drag steamlinker in to your TeamSpeak 3 Client\plugins\lua_plugin folder

3. In teamspeak 3 go to Settings --> Plugins --> Tick Lua Plugin --> Settings --> Tick steamlinker ---> Ok --> Reload all --> your done :D
